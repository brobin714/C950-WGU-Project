############## Package loading functions ##############

# Obective A:
#    Develop a hash table, without using any additional libraries or classes, that has an insertion function that takes the following components as input and inserts the components into the hash table:
#
#       package ID number
#       delivery address
#       delivery deadline
#       delivery city
#       delivery zip code
#       package weight
#       delivery status (e.g., delivered, en route)

# load_packages() - open data/packages.csv to read in package information, uses data to create Package objects stored in hash table
## sets status to pending, depart and arrive to "" until the times are updated during delivery
# O(N)
